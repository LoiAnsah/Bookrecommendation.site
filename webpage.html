    <p class="title" ><b>In my dreams I hold a Knife</b></p>
    <p class="title2" ><b>by Ashley Winstead</b> </p>
   
      <p class="para1"> 
        
      "A college reunion turns dark and deadly 
      in this chilling and propulsive suspense 
      novel about six friends, one unsolved murder, 
      and the dark secrets they have been hiding from 
      each other—and themselves—for a decade."
      <br> <br>
      This  book was definitely a page turner. 
      It single-handlely got me out of a reading
      slump.
      If you like thrillers and mystery stories, 
      you will definitely enjoy reading it. 
      The author delves into thought-provoking 
      themes, such as the impact of social status 
      on our relationships, the fragility of 
      surface-level friendships, and the relentless 
      pursuit of academic validation. The characters 
      were also well-written. I particularly love how 
      morally grey they were, easy to understand and 
      relate to. In terms of the writing, I would say 
      that what makes a thriller good is a fast pace 
      and writing that hooks the reader right from 
      the beginning, and I am convinced that the author 
      did this perfectly. Overall, if you are looking for
      a roller-coaster experience emotionally, love 
      thrillers or are open to trying new genres, 
      In My Dreams, I Hold a Knife would be the perfect 
      choice to satiate your literary cravings.
